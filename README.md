#pat-upload

A pattern that creates a drop area for uploading multiple files.

Based on [DropzoneJS](https://www.dropzonejs.com/).

##demo

To view a demo of how this pattern works, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Patternslib/pat-upload.git

The run the Makefile:

    make

And then in your browser open: http://localhost:4001


## Form protection

Some systems allow to pass a authentication token to protect against CSRF attacks.
You can do this with pat-upload by adding a URL parameter, even if the upload happens in a POST request.
This is a valid practice, see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1592446/1337474

For example, for a plone.protect style token, do:

      <fieldset class="pat-upload"
                data-pat-upload="url: https://example.com/upload?_authenticator=TOKEN"
      >
      </fieldset>
